Employee Management System in DataBase management System (DBMS)

The Employee Management System project demonstrates the efficient management of employee records in universities or similar institutions. The system provides a user-friendly interface with several options to add, delete, view, update, and search for employees. All the data is stored in a CSV file, ensuring easy accessibility and organization of information.

Key Features:

1. CSV Data Storage:
   - The project utilizes a CSV file to store employee databases.
   - The CSV file contains attributes such as EmpId, Name, Age, Email, and Phone number for each employee.

2. Add New Employee:
   - The system allows users to add new employees to the database.
   - Users can enter the necessary details such as EmpId, Name, Age, Email, and Phone number, which are then appended to the CSV file.

3. Delete Employee:
   - Users have the option to delete an existing employee from the database.
   - By providing the employee's EmpId, the system removes their record from the CSV file.

4. View All Employees:
   - The system displays all employee records stored in the CSV file.
   - Users can conveniently view the details of each employee, including their EmpId, Name, Age, Email, and Phone number.

5. Update Employee:
   - Users can update the details of an existing employee.
   - By specifying the EmpId of the employee, users can modify their Name, Age, Email, or Phone number, with the changes reflected in the CSV file.

6. Search Employee:
   - The system allows users to search for a specific employee using their EmpId.
   - Upon entering the EmpId, the system retrieves and displays the corresponding employee's details.

The Employee Management System project is implemented in Python and relies solely on the CSV module to read and write data from the CSV file. The system offers an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing employee records, ensuring accurate storage and easy retrieval of information.
